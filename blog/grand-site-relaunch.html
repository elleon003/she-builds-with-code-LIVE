    <p>Finally! After weeks of fussing, cursing, and some weeping, I have changed my completely manual static site over to Pelican!</p>
<p><img style="max-height:40rem;" class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto mb-3" src="../images/snoopy-dance-woohoo-meme.jpg" alt="Snoopy victory dance!"></p>
<p>So what does that mean? In the <a href="/blog/the-mvp-of-this-site.html">intro post</a> to this blog, I talked about using this site as an experiment, a live workplace for my web development education. Initially, it was completely static. And now, I'm employing code to do most of the manual lifting for my site.</p>
<p>Obviously, there's nothing visually different here. But sooo much has happened since my last post.</p>
<p>Learning Pelican was fun, but challenging. There aren't a ton of tutorials on it, so I pieced everything together between the docs and a few helpful blog posts.</p>
<p>So my workload to post to the site went from looking like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open <em>post.html</em> template, save as with new blog title</li>
<li>Write post</li>
<li>Edit <em>index.html</em> by copying and pasting the last post snippet, edit to match new post.</li>
<li>Upload to site via FTP</li>
</ul>
<p>to this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create new Markdown file, with header info</li>
<li>Write post</li>
<li>Run  <code>make publish upload_ssh</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Still a little more than logging into a Wordpress site, but so much more satisfying! Having an understanding of everything I have so far (more or less) has been worth it.</p>
<p>There were a few things that I just had to give up and hack a workaround:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many parts of my theme are hard coded, instead of using template tags. While it was cool to learn ultimately I don't plan on distributing this theme, so cut myself some slack there.</li>
<li>I didn't quite figure out how to add a custom 404 page to my theme, so I manually added it to the server. Since it's not in the content structure of Pelican, it will remain undisturbed.</li>
<li>I also couldn't figure out how to strip the trailing <em>.html</em> from my URL's. I tried to adjust my URL settings in Pelican, and tried to edit my .htaccess rules, but after struggling with this for an hour I decided to let it be for now.</li>
<li>Lastly, I don't have a great solution for comments on the site yet. There are some options, but I just don't know if it's worth the struggle right now. I don't have people banging down the door for comments, and at the very least I've got each post linked to my <a href="https://twitter.com/SheBuildsWCode">Twitter</a> account, so I can at least engage people there.</li>
</ul>
<p>Originally from here, I planned to build a custom CMS using Flask. However, I think I may stay in this format for a while. It's something I want to do, but to be honest it's not my top priority.</p>
<p>My main reason for trying to learn to code is that I have an idea for an app I want to build for myself. It's a budget that works for bi-weekly paychecks. I've seen a few of these online, and tried to use them, but I find I'm always stringing a bunch of hacks together to work with the main app. I've yet to find the app I want,so I'm going to build it.</p>
<p>I'm leaving Python for a little and switching to JavaScript. Specifically, I'm going to learn Vue &amp; React Native. Why Vue? I heard it was a bit easier to grasp than React, and I found a tutorial that creates a budget app with Vue. Figure it's a great intro to what I'm trying to do.</p>
<p>Here we go!</p>
