Specifically, I was tackling Vue framework. Feeling pretty confident off my success with tackling Pelican, I decided I'd start with the docs to learn it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOPE! I immediately got lost - the docs seemed to assume Vue was your third or fourth framework, so I could not keep up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I decided to utilize my free lifetime subscription to Sitepoint (it was a CRAZY deal I snapped up forever ago. Comes in handy often!). And luck would have it, they just added a Vue instruction ebook. Woo Hoo! This would do the trick, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOPE! I got into the first example, and it had so many code errors, I didn't know enough to figure out how to fix it! It was discouraging to say the least. If I couldn't get through the first example without issue, I had no confidence in the rest of the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was a little frustrated at this point....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="max-height:40rem;" class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto mb-3" src="/images/woman-biting-pencil-computer.jpg" alt="Woman biting a pencil in front of a computer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I began to realize something - part of my confusion with my resources was rooted in just understanding the base code I was looking at. I'd tried learning JavaScript early in my coding education, but I just didn't take to it and ended up with Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize now, however, that JavaScript is unavoidable for what I want to do, so it's important to me to learn the language and all it's nuances before diving into a framework. Having the experience I now have with Python and building a few things, I feel I can get a better grip diving back into the basics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I'm reading &lt;a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/"&gt;Eloquent JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; and revisiting exercises in my &lt;a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/"&gt;FreeCodeCamp&lt;/a&gt; account to build my JavaScript skills up. I'm loving the way the author breaks things down - haven't tackled any code in the first few chapters, but just a refresher on how the syntax works already feels better than any of my previous attempts at the language.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
