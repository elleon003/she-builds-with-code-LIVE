Intro: Forcing myself not to rush...
Summary: Learning Javascript, for real this time.

In my [previous post]({filename}/blog/grand-relaunch.md), I mentioned that I'm moving on to Javascript for the next step in my coding education. Specifically, I was tackling Vue framework. Feeling pretty confident off my success with tackling Pelican, I decided I'd start with the docs to learn it.

NOPE! I immediately got lost - the docs seemed to assume Vue was your third or fourth framework, so I could not keep up.

Then I decided to utilize my free lifetime subscription to Sitepoint (it was a CRAZY deal I snapped up forever ago. Comes in handy often!). And luck would have it, they just added a Vue instruction ebook. Woo Hoo! This would do the trick, right?

NOPE! I got into the first example, and it had so many code errors, I didn't know enough to figure out how to fix it! It was discouraging to say the least. If I couldn't get through the first example without issue, I had no confidence in the rest of the book.

So I was a little frustrated at this point....

But I began to realize something - part of my confusion with my resources was rooted in just understanding the base code I was looking at. I'd tried learning JavaScript early in my coding education, but I just didn't take to it and ended up with Python. 

I realize now, however, that JavaScript is unavoidable for what I want to do, so it's important to me to learn the language and all it's nuances before diving into a framework. Having the experience I now have with Python and building a few things, I feel I can get a better grip diving back into the basics.

So I'm reading [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) and revisiting exercises in my [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) account to build my JavaScript skills up. I'm loving the way the author breaks things down - haven't tackled any code in the first few chapters, but just a refresher on how the syntax works already feels better than any of my previous attempts at the language.
